# ICD-10 historical archives

Starting in 2023, CMS now updates ICD-10 twice a year. At the half-year mark
they replace the original file with the new April 1 file, which means that if
your ICD-10 ingestion process relies on taking a diff of the changes you will
not be able to unless you have a copy of the original file locally. At the time
of this writing this repository is the only place where the original 2023 file
exists.
